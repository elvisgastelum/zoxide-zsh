# Zoxide X ZSH 

This is a zoxide plugin for zsh and Zap plugin manager with my personal configurations

To use it on [Zap](https://www.zapzsh.org/) just put:

> Add this to the **end** of your config file (usually `~/.zshrc`):
>
> ```zsh
> plug "elvisgastelum/zoxide-zsh"
> ```
>
> For completions to work, the above line must be added _after_ `compinit` is
> called. You may have to rebuild your completions cache by running
> `rm ~/.zcompdump*; compinit`.
